### Hello human ðŸ‘‹

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Cybersecurity Related Studies
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning https://zsecurity.org/
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yaboknuj)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Penetration Career
- ðŸ’¬ I'm currently in Japan
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...

Age 21, Male, Half-Japanese, Half-Filipino. Would like to be instructor\teacher when I get old.
\
I graduated at [MapÃºa University](https://www.mapua.edu.ph/), December 2019. Had an intern experince in **ThreatHunting** and **System Administrator**. \
\
Even I had knowledge in programming **(C, C#, matlab)**, and networking **(CISCO)** I always wanted to pursue security side. I also love to teach and I was a voluteer at Center for Student Advising back when I was undergrad.\
\
Since I wasn't blessed to learn security related topic back when I was undergrad, I self taught myself using **udemy**, and **CTF** Challenge online. \
\
I'm trying to master tools found in **Kali**, **Python** Language, and someday **i3wm** \
While I'm being enthusiast at Cybersecurity, I would like to work to the related field.... soon
